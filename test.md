Markdown is capable of quite a lot of things. Read on to see exactly what you can do with {Placeholder Name}.

## Text

You can **bold** and *italicize* text. ***You can even* nest these styles.**

## Lists

You can use unordered (bullet) lists...

###### Things to buy:

*   Spoiled eggs
*   Answers to the math homework
*   Star wars movies watch order explanation
*   Basically at this moment, there is some funny stuff

  

And numbered lists...

###### Best programming languages

1.  Brainf\*ck
2.  English
3.  The following items have been redacted due to public outrage (did you really think it was possible to rank programming languages without anyone getting mad?)

# Quotes

You can insert quotes, so you always know *exactly* who said:

> Nisl suscipit adipiscing. Varius sit amet mattis vulputate enim nulla aliquet portadsfasdtais. Puadfadfasdfrus ut faucibus pulvinar elementum.
> Inside of a quote, you can also *italicize* and **bold** text -- just as usual.
